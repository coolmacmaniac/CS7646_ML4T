    "## What is portfolio optimization ?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **portfolio** is an allocation of funds to a set of stocks. \n",
    "**Portfolio optimization** means given a set of assets and a time period we need to find an allocation of funds to those assets that maximizes performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify performance, we can choose from a number of metrics like -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cumulative return\n",
    "2. Average return (mean)\n",
    "3. Volatility (std or risk)\n",
    "4. Risk adjusted return (Sharpe ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can proceed with risk adjusted return becuase it covers both the return and the risk. Higher is the Sharpe ratio the higher is the performance. But if we use our optimizer then it minimizes the error or cost function. We can use it to maximize the Sharpe ratio by taking a negative of Sharpe ratio as the metric.\n",

    "Minimizing the negative of Sharpe ratio means maximizing the Sharpe ratio."

    "## Returns and Kurtosis\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of returns for stocks and market indices looks **very similar to Gaussian** but it is not truly Gaussian. This behaviour is observed for all types of returns like daily, weekly, monthly and annual etc. returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If those returns were really Gaussian (which they are not) then we would have said that those were normally distributed which means to have a Kurtosis of 3 or Excess Kurtosis of 0. But in reality their **kurtosis is more than 3 which means their excess kurtosis is more than 0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kurtosis is the probability of a value lying in the tails of the distribution. The higher the kurtosis is the more the number of values lying in the tails are and the thicker the tails become.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many research cases we assume the financial returns to be normally distributed but it can be very dangerous because we ignore their kurtosis. For example, the recession of 2008 due to sub-prime lender crisis when the people committed defaults on their mortgages. The lenders made 2 assumptions both of which were wrong -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The returns were assumed to be independent (proved to be wrong after the losses)\n",
    "2. The returns were assumed to be normally distributed (proved to be wrong after the losses)"

Each `pos_val` shows the open position value for each asset over time to show how much it is worth after each unit period.\n",
    "* We calculate `port_val = pos_vals.sum(axis=1)` which gives the total portfolio value for each period by summing up the value of each individual asset over that period. The `port_val[0]` is same as `start_val` but the `port_val[-1]` gives the final worth of the portfolio on `end_date`."

    "* From `port_val` we calculate the `daily_rets` if we are using daily prices, otherwise we can also call it as `returns`. First row is always `0` as there is no previous period price before the first period. Pandas fills it as `NaN`. We can drop the first row using `daily_rets = daily_rets[1:]` or `daily_rets.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)` to keep the genuine values.\n",
    "* We can calculate any of these metrics to compute the portfolio performance -\n",
    "    + `cum_ret`: How much the value of the portfolio has gone up from the beginning of the period till the end of the period, this is calculated as `(port_val[-1] / port_val[0] ) - 1`.\n",

    "    + `std_daily_ret`: Standard deviation of returns over the entire period calculate as `daily_rets.std()`.\n",
    "    + `sharpe_ratio`: Risk adjusted return calculated as `mean(daily_rets) / std(daily_rets)`. If we put the discounted `daily_rf` in that we get `mean(daily_rets - daily_rf) / std(daily_rets - daily_rf)` and we see that `daily_rf` impacts the `mean` but doesn't affect the `std` because deviation of a distribution after adding a constant to each value is still the same, the constant gets cancelled out. So we get the updated formula as `mean(daily_rets - daily_rf) / std(daily_rets)`. Usually we use `sharpe_ratio` as a metric for optimization and consider its maximum possible value such that the return is maximum possible and the risk is minimum possible.\n",
    "* We convert Sharpe Ratio to annualized value by using `Sharpe_ratio_annual = sharpe_ratio * sqrt(252)` and use it for analysis and comparison of the portfolio performance."
